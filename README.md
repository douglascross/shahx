1. Make web programming fun again!
2. No compilation necessary.
3. Micro manageable.
4. Simple requirements.

How to use?
-----------
	<script type="text/javascript" src="shahx.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    shh.require('<somewhere>/<something>.js');
    shh.ready(function () {
    	shh.log('Hello World!');
    });
    </script>

FAQ
---
*Why is it called shahx?*
The domain was available.

*Why aren't you using other existing frameworks?*
I don't like them.

*Why should I use this framework?*
You shouldn't. It's only just been started.

*Why are you using "shh" as a prefix and not "shahx"?*
Let's face it shahx as a name doesn't have much staying power. Maybe one day I'll buy the shh.com or shh.net domain.
